## 🔧 How to Debug Common Issues

### **Issue 1: AI Not Generating Questions**

**Look for:**
```
❌ [AI SERVICE] gemini failed: API quota exceeded
🔄 [AI SERVICE] Trying fallback provider: openai
```

**Solution:**
- Check if Gemini API key is valid
- Verify OpenAI key if fallback is triggered
- System will use pre-defined questions if both fail

---

### **Issue 2: Follow-ups Not Working**

**Look for:**
```
🔍 [CONVERSATION] Decision criteria: {
    followUpNeeded: false,  ← Should be true
    depthAllowed: true,
    qualityCheck: false,     ← Check quality
    shouldAskFollowUp: false
}
```

**Debug:**
- Check if `followUpNeeded` is true in analysis
- Verify `followUpDepth` hasn't hit max (3)
- Ensure quality is 'fair' or completeness is 'partial'

---

### **Issue 3: Answer Analysis Failing**

**Look for:**
```
⚠️ [GEMINI] JSON parse failed for analysis
📄 [GEMINI] Raw response: The answer shows...  ← Not JSON!
🔄 [FALLBACK] Generating fallback answer analysis...
```

**Solution:**
- AI returned text instead of JSON
- System automatically uses fallback heuristics
- Check prompt formatting if persistent

---

### **Issue 4: Infinite Follow-up Loop**

**Look for:**
```
📊 [CONVERSATION] Current follow-up depth: 3 / 3
✅ [CONVERSATION] Decision: Move to next main question
📊 [CONVERSATION] Reason: Max depth reached
```

**This is normal!** Depth limit prevents endless follow-ups.

## 🚀 Quick Debug Checklist

When something goes wrong, check logs in this order:

1. **Frontend Console** (Browser DevTools)
   - Check for frontend errors
   - Look for API call responses
   - Verify decision-making logic

2. **Backend Console** (Terminal)
   - Check API endpoint logs
   - Verify AI service calls
   - Look for database errors

3. **AI Service Logs**
   - Check provider initialization
   - Verify API responses
   - Look for fallback triggers

4. **Network Tab** (Browser DevTools)
   - Verify API calls are being made
   - Check response status codes
   - Inspect request/response bodies

## 💡 Tips for Reading Logs

1. **Use separators:** Look for `========` lines to find section starts
2. **Follow the flow:** Logs are sequential, follow the story
3. **Check symbols:** ✅ = good, ❌ = problem, 🔄 = processing
4. **Error blocks:** Multi-line errors have details (name, message, stack)
5. **Decision points:** 🎯 logs show why decisions were made

## 🔍 Example Debug Session

**Problem:** User complains follow-ups aren't working

**Step 1:** Check frontend console
```
Found: 🔍 [CONVERSATION] Decision criteria: {
    followUpNeeded: true,
    depthAllowed: true,
    qualityCheck: false,  ← Issue found!
}
```

**Step 2:** Check analysis
```
Found: 📊 [ANALYZE] Analysis: {
    quality: 'excellent',  ← This is why!
    completeness: 'complete'
}
```

**Diagnosis:** Answer was too good, no follow-up needed. System working correctly!
